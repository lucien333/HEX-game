Hi everyone I am currently coding a hex game with pygame. I would like someone to help me with a problem I can't solve, let me explain.
I made 2 sprites, one for the hexagons that I put in a group and one for the mouse that I also put in a group. Hex is a turn based game and I would like that when you click the first time on a hexagon it becomes red and when you click the second time on another hexagon it becomes blue. Also it should be that when a hexagon has changed colors it can't change again. I imagine that we have to use the function sprite.collide() but apart from making the hexagons disappear when we click on them it doesn't help me.  To clarify when I say "change color" it would be more like change image. First i recommended you to start the main.py so you could "visualize". I hope someone can help me because I'm really stuck!
